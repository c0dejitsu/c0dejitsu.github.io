Welcome to team CodeJitsu’s blog! Over the coming days, this blog will
host a series of articles to introduce you to the fascinating Galactica
CRS. What’s that? Read on.

Galactica is a Cyber Reasoning System, or CRS for short. It is a machine
that analyzes computer programs, finds software flaws, and fixes them –
fully automatically. In August 2016, Galactica was one of the seven
finalists that competed in the Cyber Grand Challenge, an all-machine
computer security tournament.

What makes Galactica special?

    It’s *lightning fast* – During the competition, there were seven
    cases where Galactica was the first to find a
    software vulnerability. It needed as little as 92 seconds to
    download a program, analyze it, find a crash and generate a
    reliable exploit.

    It’s *ferocious* – Galactica generated 392 successful attacks during
    the competition, about twice as much as the first and
    second-placed teams.

    It’s *efficient* – While protecting programs against opponents’
    attacks, Galactica caused a 2% increase in CPU consumption and
    less than 1% increase in memory usage, on average.

In the coming days, we will explain on this blog the technology that
makes these results possible. Stay tuned for first-hand insights from
the creators of the Galactica CRS.

And do ask questions! Write them in the comment section below, and we
promise to answer. What do you find exciting? What aspects should we
write about?
